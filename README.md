# RGSG - Random Good Seed Glitchless

This is a new category for speedrunners designed to capture the feel of RSG with seeds that are of a certain guaranteed quality without the pre-planned feel of SSG.

In essence twitch streamers can be more entertaining by playing more seeds.

Just hit the RUN button to get a never before run seed with good speedrun traits.

The key to this as a category is that the seeds are chosen using a cryptographically secure random number generator and tested after the fact for a few key traits.

So when submitting a run please film the code running that generates your seed and start the world right after.

The current "good seed" traits:
  A village in the pos/pos quadrant of the overworld between 0 and 96 in both X and Z
  A ruined_portal in the same area (0 to 96)
  In the nether there is a structure close to 0,0 in all four quadrants these are all designed to be within 128 of 0,0 in each coordinate although in the negative dimensions they can't be produced with values between -64 and 0.

It is possible that if a bastion would have spawned and the biome ends up as a basalt delta then no structure will be near by in that quadrant.
It is also possible to get 3 bastions of 3 fortresses.

No restrictions are made on the stronghold in anyway.

If you're interested in helping this category grow you can help in several ways:
  Make and record runs and post them in the pb-brag channel, we can keep track of unofficial WRs for this category.
  If you're a seed finder help improve the algorithm, attributes, and the balance between unpredictable and of sufficient quality.
  Help us specify the standards for the category to be serious enough.

Special thanks to Matthew, Kaptain, Neil, Cubitect, Denry, and the seed finding community for their support3
